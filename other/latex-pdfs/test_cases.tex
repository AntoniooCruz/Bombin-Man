\emph{\large The Test Cases that are expected to be implemented in this project are the following:}

\begin{itemize}
\item Server-side Tests:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Verify if the player moves in the correct directions
	\item Verify if a Player can place a bomb in its current position
	\item Verify if when a Player collides with an explosion he dies
	\item Test if a box is destroyed if an explosion is in its boundaries
	\item Verify if a Player without the BombKicking powerUp cannot move if he is colliding with a bomb
	\item Verify if a Player with the BombKicking powerUp can kick the bomb if he collides with it
	\item Test if the game ends if only 1 player is alive
	\item Test if the bomb explodes after a certain time
	\item Test if the bomb radius increases after collecting certain powerUps
	\item Test if the limit of bombs is respected when attempting to place another bomb
	\end{itemize}
\item Client-side Tests:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Check if the client was able to connect successfully
	\item Check if all commands (Move Up, Down, Place Bomb) are sent to the server
	\item Test state changes by spoofing the sending of specific messages to the client (without needing communication, by directly routing the messages)
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
